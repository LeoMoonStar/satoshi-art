You may only participate in the Auction by linking your digital wallets on supported bridge extensions. Before putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset, we will ask you to download a supported electronic wallet extension, and connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an order to purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf.\n\n“Crypto Assets” refers to unique non-fungible tokens using smart contracts.\n\nALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY ELECTRONIC WALLET EXTENSIONS, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS. \n\nSATOSHI.ART IS A PLATFORM.

NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, SATOSHI.ART MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS ON THE PLATFORM.\n\nBecause we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe additional terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.\n\nTHESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.\n\nBY CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING OUR SERVICES AND/OR PURCHASING CRYPTO ASSETS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service or purchase the Crypto Assets.\n\nSatoshi.ART reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference.

Openness is one of our most prized values, and we’re committed to providing a platform for the exchange of a wide range of content, including controversial content.

We carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our policies before deciding to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections when we discover them or they’re brought to our attention.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>8.4.</i>\tAssets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that Satoshi.ART deems inappropriate, disruptive, or illegal are prohibited on Satoshi.ART.

If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>12.1.8.</i>\tThere are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferrable. Satoshi.ART reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on Satoshi.ART. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on Satoshi.ART serve as grounds for a claim against Satoshi.ART.\n</p>\n</span>\n</p>",
